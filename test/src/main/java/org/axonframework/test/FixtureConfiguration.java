/**
 * Interface describing the operations available on a test fixture in the configuration stage. This stage allows a test
 * case to prepare the fixture for test execution.
 * <p/>
 * In the preparation stage, you should register all components required for your test, mainly the command handler. A
 * typical command handler will require a repository. The test fixture can create a generic repository using the {@link
 * #createGenericRepository(Class)} method. Alternatively, you can register your own repository using the {@link
 * #registerRepository(org.axonframework.eventsourcing.EventSourcingRepository)} method. Registering the repository
 * will
 * cause the fixture to configure the correct {@link EventBus} and {@link EventStore} implementations required by the
 * test.
 * <p/>
 * Typical usage example:<br/> <code>
 * <pre>
 * public class MyCommandHandlerTest() {
 * <br/>       private FixtureConfiguration fixture;
 * <br/>      {@code @}Before
 *     public void setUp() {
 *         fixture = Fixtures.newGivenWhenThenFixture();
 *         MyCommandHandler commandHandler = new MyCommandHandler();
 *         commandHandler.setRepository(fixture.<strong>createGenericRepository(MyAggregate.class)</strong>);
 *         fixture.<strong>registerAnnotatedCommandHandler(commandHandler)</strong>;
 *     }
 * <br/>      {@code @}Test
 *     public void testCommandHandlerCase() {
 *         fixture.<strong>given(new MyEvent(1), new MyEvent(2))</strong>
 *                .when(new TestCommand())
 *                .expectReturnValue(Void.TYPE)
 *                .expectEvents(new MyEvent(3));
 *     }
 * <br/>  }
 * </pre>
 * </code>
 * <p/>
 * Providing the "given" events using the {@link #given(org.axonframework.domain.DomainEvent...)} or {@link
 * #given(java.util.List) given(List&lt;DomainEvent&gt;)} methods must be the last operation in the configuration
 * stage.
 * <p/>
 * Besides setting configuration, you can also use the FixtureConfiguration to get access to the configured components.
 * This allows you to (manually) inject the EventBus or any other component into you command handler, for example.
