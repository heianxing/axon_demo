 * Wrapper around an input stream that can be used to read simple values, written using the {@link

 * the entries (except for binary entries) may not contain whitespace themselves.
 * <p/>
 * The BinaryEntryInputStream does not read ahead. It will read up to and inclusive the next whitespace each time is
 * read. When byte arrays are read, it will first read an entry containing its size, and then the exact number of bytes
 * as indicated in the size entry. Any whitespace character followed by the byte array is not read.
 * <p/>
 * This class is meant for internal use, and should be used with care.
