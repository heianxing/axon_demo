/**
 * Interceptor that keeps track of commands and the events that were dispatched as a result of handling that command.
 * The AuditingInterceptor uses the current Unit Of Work to track all events being stored and published. The auditing
 * information provided by the {@link org.axonframework.auditing.AuditDataProvider} is attached to each of these events
 * just before the Unit Of Work is committed. After the Unit Of Work has been committed, an optional {@link
 * org.axonframework.auditing.AuditLogger} may write an entry to the audit logs.
 * <p/>
 * Note that this class requires a Unit Of Work to be available. This means that you should always configure a Unit Of
 * Work interceptor <em>before</em> the AuditingInterceptor. Failure to do so will result in an {@link
 * org.axonframework.util.AxonConfigurationException}.
 * <p/>
 * The auditing interceptor can only attach meta data to event whose {@link org.axonframework.domain.Event#getMetaData()}
 * methods returns an instance of {@link org.axonframework.domain.MutableEventMetaData}, which is the default behavior
 * for any event implementation provided by Axon.
